# New Preprint!
As a student deeply interested in statistical research, I am both humbled and excited to share that our paper, "Design-Based Causal Inference with Missing Outcomes: Missingness Mechanisms, Imputation-Assisted Randomization Tests, and Covariate Adjustment," has been published.

Having the opportunity to contribute as a co-first author alongside Professor Siyu Heng and under the guidance of Professor Yang Feng has been a truly invaluable experience.

In our paper, we introduce new method designed to manage the often troublesome issue of missing data within design-based causal inference.

For those interested, you can read the paper on arXiv with the ID: 2310.18556.
